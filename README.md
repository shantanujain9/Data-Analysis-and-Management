# Data-Analysis-and-Management

## Description

This is a class project, where I used python programming to analyze Excel data tables. My program processes, corrects and visualizes these datasets using Panda, Numpy libraries. 
In this class, I learnt how to manage and analyze data using Pandas and Numpy library. I also learnt to to use mySQL database.

#### Each project folder also contains a "README" which describes the Questionnaire of the project. 

## How to Run

You will need 
-Juypter Notebook or VS code or any other platform that supports python and JSON files.
-Numpy and pandas libraries.
-After installing, you can simply run the files. 

You will find that the dataset gets corrected and it gets visualized. Code also analyzes data to fill in the cavaties.
