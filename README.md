# Data-Analysis-and-Management

## Description

This was a class project, where I used python programming to analyze Excel data tables. Processed, corrected and visualized these datasets using Panda, Numpy libraries. Also used MySQL database to store and manage the data.

## How to Run

You will need Juypter Notebook, VS code or any other platform that supports python and '.ipynb' files.
You will also need Numpy and pandas libraries.

After installing, you can run the .ipynb files. After running the code, you will find corrected data in excel tables and analysis in the markdown cells.
